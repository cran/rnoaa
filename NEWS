rnoaa 0.3.3
===============

NEW FEATURES

+ New data source NOAA legacy API with ISD, daily, and ish data via function
`ncdc_legacy()`. (#54)
+ New function `isd()` to get ISD data from NOAA FTP server. (#76)
+ ERDDAP gridded data sets added. Now tabledap datasets are accessible via
`erddap_table()`, while gridded datasets are available via `erddap_grid()`. Helper
function `erddap_search()` was modified to search for either tabledap or griddap
datasets, and `erddap_info()` gets and prints summary information differently
for tabledap and griddap datasets. (#63)

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

+ `erddap_data()` defunct, now as functions `erddap_table()` and `erddap_grid()`, uses new
`store` parameter which takes a function, either `disk(path, overwrite)` to store
on disk or `memory()` to store in R memory.
+ `assertthat` library removed, replaced with `stopifnot()`

rnoaa 0.3.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

+ New data source added (NOAA torndoes data) via function `tornadoes()`. (#56)
+ New data source added (NOAA storm data from IBTrACS) via functions
`storm_*()`. (#57)
+ New data source added (NOAA weather station metadata from HOMR) via functions
`homr_*()` (#59)
+ New vignettes for storm data and homr data.
+ Some functions in rnoaa now print data.frame outputs as `dplyr`-like outputs
with a summary of the data.frame, as appropriate.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

+ Across all `ncdc_*` functions changed `callopts` parameter to `...`. This parameter
allow you to pass in options to `httr::GET` to modify curl requests. (#61)
+ A new helper function `check_key()` looks for one of two stored keys, as an
environment variable under the name `NOAA_KEY`, or an option variable under the name
`noaakey`. Environment variables can be set during session like `Sys.setenv(VAR = "...")`,
or stored long term in your `.Renviron` file. Option variables can be set during session
like `options(var = "...")`, or stored long term in your `.Rprofile` file.
+ `is.*` and `print.*` functions no longer have public man files, but can be seen via
`rnoaa:::` if needed.

rnoaa 0.2.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* New package imports: `sp`, `rgeos`, `assertthat`, `jsonlite`, and `ncdf4`, and new package Suggests: `knitr`, `taxize`
* Most function names changed. All `noaa*()` functions for NCDC data changed to `ncdc*()`. `noaa_buoy()` changed to `buoy()`. `noaa_seaice()` changed to `seaice()`. When you call the old versions an error is thrown, with a message pointing you to the new function name. See ?rnoaa-defunct.
* New vignettes: NCDC attributes, NCDC workflow, Seaice vignette, SWDI vignette, ERDDAP vignette, NOAA buoy vignette.
* New functions to interact with NOAA ERDDAP data: `erddap_info()`, `erddap_data()`, and `erddap_search()`.
* New functions to interact with NOAA buoy data: `buoy()`, including a number of helper functions.
* `ncdc()` now splits apart attributes. Previously, the attributes were returned as a single column, but now there is column for each attribute so data can be easily retrieved. Attribute columns differ for each different `datasetid`.
* `buoy()` function has been removed from the CRAN version of `rnoaa`. Install the version with `buoy()` and associated functions via `devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnoaa", ref="buoy")`

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `noaa_swdi()` (function changed to `swdi()`) gains new parameter `filepath` to specify path to write a file to if `format=kmz` or `format=shp`. Examples added for using `format=` csv, shp, and kmz.
* Now using internal version of `plyr::compact`.
* Added API response checker/handler to all functions to pass on helpful messages on server errors.
* `ncdc()` gains new parameter `includemetadata`. If TRUE, includes metadata, if not, does not, and response should be faster as does not take time to calculate metadata.
* `noaa_stations()` gains new parameter `radius`. If `extent` is a vector of length 4 (for a bounding box) then radius is ignored, but if you pass in two points to `extent`, it is interpreted as a point, and then `radius` is used as the distance upon which to construct a bounding box. `radius` default is 10 km.

BUG FIXES

* `datasetid`, `startdate`, and `enddate` are often required parameters, and changes were made to help users with this.


rnoaa 0.1.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Submitted to CRAN.


rnoaa 0.0.8
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Wrote new functions for NOAA API v2.
* A working vignette now.


rnoaa 0.0.1
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Wrappers for NOAA API v1 were written, not on CRAN at this point.
